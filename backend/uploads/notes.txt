ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE NOTES

Introduction to AI:
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

Machine Learning:
Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide.

Deep Learning:
Deep learning is a machine learning technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans: learn by example. Deep learning is a key technology behind driverless cars, enabling them to recognize a stop sign, or to distinguish a pedestrian from a lamppost.

Neural Networks:
Neural networks are a series of algorithms that endeavor to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. In this sense, neural networks refer to systems of neurons, either organic or artificial in nature.

Natural Language Processing (NLP):
NLP is a branch of AI that helps computers understand, interpret and manipulate human language. NLP combines computational linguistics with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models.

Computer Vision:
Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do.

Reinforcement Learning:
Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward.

AI Applications:
- Virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa)
- Recommendation systems (Netflix, Amazon)
- Fraud detection in banking
- Medical diagnosis systems
- Autonomous vehicles
- Language translation

Key Concepts:
- Supervised Learning: Training with labeled data
- Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
- Semi-supervised Learning: Combination of labeled and unlabeled data
- Transfer Learning: Using pre-trained models for new tasks

Future of AI:
The future of AI includes more advanced machine learning capabilities, better natural language processing, and increased integration into daily life through IoT devices and smart systems.
